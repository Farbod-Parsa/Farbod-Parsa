### Hi there 👋
I'm Farbod Parsa, a programming polyglot who thrives in the dynamic landscapes of Python 🐍 and Ruby 💎.

💻 With a +1 years of coding under my belt, I'm a passionate advocate for the versatility of Python and the elegance of Ruby.

🚀 I lead projects that seamlessly weave Pythonic pragmatism and Ruby's poetic expressiveness.

📚 An unquenchable thirst for knowledge keeps me exploring the latest trends, frameworks, and design patterns. My code is not just functional; it tells a story of readability, scalability, and craftsmanship.

🔗 Let's connect and share insights on Python, Ruby, or anything code-related! Catch me on Instagram for a blend of tech updates and witty developer banter.

Happy coding! 🚀
